# Traffic_Light_Controller
The purpose of this project is to design a traffic light controller for a T-junction Road and 4 way traffic control . The logic design is a practical example of a Moore type of Finite State Machine and has been implemented using six states. The code has been written in verilog and simulated on the software Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7
